**Sanitization FAIL:** 200 / 500
**Sanitization SAFETY-LIMITED-REVIEWED:** 18 / 500
**Completeness revalidated:** 340 / 500 — 166 PASS / 174 FAIL
**Boundary/alignment revalidated:** 0 / 500  
**Confirmed new failures:** 200 Phase-1 sanitization failures plus 174 Phase-2 completeness failures; 58 completeness-only additions (42, 48, 55, 61, 63, 69, 70, 71, 72, 78, 79, 80, 82, 101, 103, 141, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 156, 165, 168, 175, 178, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 187, 190, 192, 193, 200, 207, 211, 212, 216, 217, 236, 259, 264, 266, 271, 273, 275, 281, 282, 283, 300, 307, 326, 329, 331, 332, 335) raise the combined remediation population to 258 unique chapters
**Current phase:** Phase 2 ACTIVE — completeness through Chapter 340; next `Private Life (341–342)`
**Project completion:** NOT RELEASE-COMPLETE while Cycle 2 is active  
**EPUB assembly:** BLOCKED  
**Audit plan:** qa/manuscript-sanitization-completeness-cycle2.md

## Current priority

The immediate project focus is a fresh, exhaustive **sanitization + completeness full pass across Chapters 1–500**.

The 2026-09-20 post-500 completeness audit remains a closed historical cycle. It found and repaired major compression failures, including Chapters 59, 97, 316, 319, and 420, and ended with 500 accepted / 0 known rework.

Cycle 2 is stricter in scope: every target chapter must now be freshly reviewed rather than only anomaly-prioritized or residual low-tail families.

## Phase 0 result

Phase 0 completed successfully against opening main commit `8177e1c192cd7fcd55b04009fbe826bbd50f586b`.

- 500 targets and 118 title-family units inventoried.
- 36 source-exception rows reconciled.
- 500 draft / 500 chapter QA / 500 provenance / 500 acceptance paths verified.
- 0 acceptance-SHA mismatches and 0 missing evidence paths.
- 31 deterministic diagnostic files cover all 500 chapters with no gaps or overlaps.
- No accepted manuscript/evidence content changed during baseline capture.

Phase 1 began with **Hellhound (1–3)** and is now complete through Chapter 500.

## Required gates

A chapter/family is not Cycle-2 clear until it has:

- sanitization-fidelity review;
- complete Chinese-source coverage review;
- boundary/alignment/exception integrity review;
- remediation and refreshed evidence if any defect is found.

Sanitization review checks both source softening and unwarranted intensification. Completeness review checks dialogue, narration, description, transitions, internal thought, information windows, numeric/mechanical detail, scene order, and chapter boundaries.

Historical acceptance remains evidence but is not a Cycle-2 pass.

## Phase sequence

1. Baseline freeze and complete audit inventory.
2. Full-corpus sanitization fidelity sweep.
3. True full-corpus completeness pass.
4. Corpus boundary/alignment/exception integrity pass.
5. Remediation and QA/provenance/acceptance rebinding.
6. Independent residual verification and consistency sweep.
7. Closure/hash validation and EPUB unblock.

The detailed phase definitions, exit gates, and checkpoint requirements are maintained in qa/manuscript-sanitization-completeness-cycle2.md.

## Active Cycle-2 findings

Phase 1 sanitization is **COMPLETE**:

- Chapters reviewed: **500 / 500**
- PASS: **282**
- FAIL: **200**
- SAFETY-LIMITED-REVIEWED: **18**
- manuscript edits during Phase-1 discovery: **0**

All 200 sanitization FAIL chapters remain in `qa/cycle2-ledger.json` for Phase 4.

Phase 2 completeness has reached **Chapter 340**:

- reviewed: **340 / 500**
- PASS: **166**
- FAIL: **174**
- **116** completeness failures overlap Phase-1 FAIL chapters
- completeness-only additions: **42, 48, 55, 61, 63, 69, 70, 71, 72, 78, 79, 80, 82, 101, 103, 141, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 156, 165, 168, 175, 178, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 187, 190, 192, 193, 200, 207, 211, 212, 216, 217, 236, 259, 264, 266, 271, 273, 275, 281, 282, 283, 300, 307, 326, 329, 331, 332, 335**
- combined Cycle-2 remediation population: **258 unique chapters**
- manuscript edits during Phase-2 discovery: **0**

Formal corpus boundary/alignment clearance remains Phase 3.

Next is **Private Life (341–342)**. Latest checkpoint: `qa/cycle2-phase2-checkpoint-0340.md`.

## Release gate

Complete-EPUB assembly, presentation QA, and final packaging are deferred until Cycle 2 formally closes with all 500 chapters resolved on both primary gates, all structural exceptions resolved, no outstanding remediation, and all live evidence/hash bindings validated.
